# Mashup

As the name says it's a mashup from Google maps API and Google News. It shows a map(primarily focused at the USA) where different places are marked with a symbol. If you go any click on it a pop-up comes up which shows all the primary news fetched from Google news in real time. 

A preview is available here(https://mashup.cs50.net/).
